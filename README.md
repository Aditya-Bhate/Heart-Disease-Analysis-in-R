# Heart-Disease-Analysis-in-R 🩺❤

## About :
1) Libraries
2) Data Transformation
3) Data Visualization
4) Correlation
5) Training and testing the data 
6) Support vector machine
7) Random forest
8) Comparison of AUC and Accuracy between models
9) Confusion matrix

## Result :
📍 A comparison of the area under the ROC and the accuracy of the model predictions shows that logistic regression performs best (accuracy of 0.87). Tree-based methods shows low accuracy.
📍 Random forest has higher accuracy than support vector machine to detect heart disease.
